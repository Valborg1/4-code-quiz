## Code Quiz

The code quiz is a simple game taht allows the user to experience the the functionality of DOM manipulation, a timer, and JSON.

I added a start screen that gives instructions. The game timer only starts after the "Start Game" button is clicked:

Once the quiz is initiated the user will be given a multiple choice question and can make a selection from the choices offered. The options are generated using an object array.

After all 5 questions are answered, the user is able to enter their initials [AAA] to be placed on the scorebord.

After you submit your score, you can see your previous scores which are sorted from highest to lowest. At this point, you will also have the option to play again using the "Play Again" button which takes you back to the start of the game.
